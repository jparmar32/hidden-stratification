# Group DRO Implementation

This repository implements the "GEORGE" algorithm from the following paper [No Subclass Left Behind: Fine-Grained Robustness in Coarse-Grained Classification Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12945) but for the purpose of the CS329D project we specifically use it to run the group DRO optimizattion problem on our dataset. 

## Setup instructions

Prerequisites: Make sure you have Python>=3.6 and PyTorch>=1.5 installed. Then, install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, either add the base directory of the repository to your PYTHONPATH, or run:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
